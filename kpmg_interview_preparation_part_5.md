# Advanced Java Interview Questions - PART 5

> **Interviewer Insight**: These questions typically appear in mid to senior-level Java interviews. They focus on Java's newer features, architecture knowledge, and practical problem-solving skills rather than basic syntax.

## 1. What are the different methods provided by the Optional class in Java? 🔄

> **Why this is asked**: This question tests your knowledge of Java 8+ features and how you handle null values in your code.
The Optional class in Java provides several methods to handle nullable values:

- **of(T value)**: Creates an Optional with the specified non-null value
- **ofNullable(T value)**: Creates an Optional with the specified value, or empty if null
- **empty()**: Returns an empty Optional instance
- **isPresent()**: Returns true if a value is present
- **isEmpty()** (Java 11+): Returns true if no value is present
- **get()**: Returns the value if present, otherwise throws NoSuchElementException
- **orElse(T other)**: Returns the value if present, otherwise returns the specified default
- **orElseGet(Supplier<? extends T> supplier)**: Returns the value if present, otherwise invokes the supplier and returns its result
- **orElseThrow()**: Returns the value if present, otherwise throws NoSuchElementException
- **ifPresent(Consumer<? super T> action)**: Executes the given action if a value is present
- **filter(Predicate<? super T> predicate)**: Returns an Optional describing the value, if present and matches the predicate
- **map(Function<? super T, ? extends U> mapper)**: Applies the mapper function to the value if present
- **flatMap(Function<? super T, ? extends Optional<? extends U>> mapper)**: Similar to map but the mapper returns an Optional

Example:
```java
Optional<String> optional = Optional.ofNullable(getName());
String name = optional.orElse("Default Name");
```

## 2. How does garbage collection work in Java? 🗑️

> **Why this is asked**: Interviewers want to check if you understand JVM memory management, which impacts application performance.

Java's garbage collection is an automatic memory management process that identifies and removes objects no longer needed by the application.

### Process:
1. **Marking**: Identifies which objects are in use and which are not
2. **Deletion**: Removes unreferenced objects
3. **Compaction**: Compacts remaining objects to reduce fragmentation

### Types of GC:
- **Serial GC**: Single-threaded, suitable for small applications
- **Parallel GC**: Multiple threads for collection, good for multi-processor machines
- **Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS)**: Minimizes pauses by doing most work concurrently
- **G1 GC (Garbage First)**: Server-style GC, replaces CMS for most use cases
- **ZGC** (Java 11+): Designed for very low pause times

### Generations:
- **Young Generation**: New objects, divided into Eden and Survivor spaces
- **Old Generation**: Long-lived objects promoted from Young Generation
- **Metaspace** (previously PermGen): Class metadata

## 3. As a software developer, what are some good practices for software development? 📝

## 4. What is the difference between ConcurrentHashMap and Synchronized HashMap with examples? 🧵

> **Why this is asked**: This tests your understanding of thread-safety and concurrent programming concepts.

| ConcurrentHashMap | Synchronized HashMap |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Fine-grained locking (segment/bucket level) | Coarse-grained locking (entire map) |
| Better performance in concurrent environments | Lower performance with high concurrency |
| Null keys and values not allowed | Allows one null key and multiple null values |
| No locking for read operations | Locks for both read and write operations |
| Introduced in Java 5 | Created by using Collections.synchronizedMap() |

### Examples:

**ConcurrentHashMap:**
```java
ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> concurrentMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
concurrentMap.put("key1", 1);
concurrentMap.put("key2", 2);

// Multiple threads can read simultaneously
Runnable readTask = () -> {
    System.out.println(concurrentMap.get("key1"));
};

// Only locks the affected segment during write
Runnable writeTask = () -> {
    concurrentMap.put("key3", 3);
};
```

**Synchronized HashMap:**
```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
Map<String, Integer> synchronizedMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(map);

synchronizedMap.put("key1", 1);
synchronizedMap.put("key2", 2);

// Must synchronize when iterating
synchronized (synchronizedMap) {
    Iterator<String> iterator = synchronizedMap.keySet().iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        System.out.println(synchronizedMap.get(iterator.next()));
    }
}
```

## 5. What is multithreading in Java, and why is it useful? 🧠

> **Why this is asked**: Multithreading is essential for modern applications. This evaluates if you can utilize CPU resources efficiently.

Multithreading in Java is the ability to execute multiple threads concurrently within a single program. A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.

### Benefits:
- **Improved Performance**: Utilizing multiple CPU cores
- **Responsiveness**: UI remains responsive while background tasks run
- **Resource Sharing**: Threads share the memory and resources of the process
- **Economy**: Creating threads requires fewer resources than creating processes

### Java Thread Creation:
1. **Extending Thread class**:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

// Usage
MyThread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start();
```

2. **Implementing Runnable interface** (preferred):
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

// Usage
Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
thread.start();
```

3. **Using Lambda (Java 8+)**:
```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Thread is running");
});
thread.start();
```

### Thread Lifecycle:
- New
- Runnable
- Blocked
- Waiting
- Timed Waiting
- Terminated

## 6. What are the commonly used annotations in a Spring project? 🏷️

> **Why this is asked**: Spring is annotation-heavy; understanding these shows you can work effectively with the framework.

### Core Spring Annotations:
- **@Component**: Marks a class as a Spring component
- **@Service**: Indicates that a class is a service layer component
- **@Repository**: Indicates that a class is a data repository
- **@Controller**: Indicates that a class is a controller (Spring MVC)
- **@RestController**: Combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody
- **@Configuration**: Indicates that a class contains Spring bean definitions
- **@Bean**: Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by Spring

### Dependency Injection:
- **@Autowired**: Marks a constructor, field, or setter method to be autowired
- **@Qualifier**: Specifies which bean should be autowired when multiple options exist
- **@Value**: Injects values from properties files

### Spring MVC:
- **@RequestMapping**: Maps HTTP requests to handler methods
- **@GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.**: Shortcuts for @RequestMapping with specific HTTP methods
- **@RequestParam**: Binds request parameters to method parameters
- **@PathVariable**: Binds template variables in the URL to method parameters
- **@RequestBody**: Binds the HTTP request body to an object
- **@ResponseBody**: Indicates that the return value should be bound to the web response body

### Spring Boot:
- **@SpringBootApplication**: Combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan
- **@EnableAutoConfiguration**: Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism
- **@ConfigurationProperties**: Binds external configurations to POJOs

### Spring Data:
- **@Transactional**: Defines transaction boundaries and rollback rules
- **@Query**: Defines a custom query in Spring Data repositories

## 7. What are the advantages of using YAML files over properties files in Spring Boot? ⚙️

> **Why this is asked**: This checks your experience with Spring Boot configuration approaches.

| YAML Files | Properties Files |
|------------|------------------|
| Hierarchical configuration | Flat configuration structure |
| Cleaner and more readable for complex configs | Simple for basic configurations |
| Support for lists and maps | Requires special notation for lists |
| Environment-specific configs in one file | Typically requires separate files |
| Better for complex configurations | Better for simple configurations |

### YAML Example:
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
    username: user
    password: password
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true
  profiles:
    active: development
server:
  port: 8080
```

### Properties Example:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.profiles.active=development
server.port=8080
```

## 8. What is the Stream API in Java, and how is it used? 🌊

> **Why this is asked**: Stream API represents modern Java programming style; mastery shows you write clean, functional code.

The Stream API, introduced in Java 8, provides a functional approach to processing collections of objects. It allows operations to be performed on elements of collections in a declarative way.

### Key Features:
- **Functional Programming**: Uses lambda expressions and method references
- **Pipeline Operations**: Chaining multiple operations together
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Computations are only performed when necessary
- **Parallel Processing**: Can easily switch between sequential and parallel execution

### Common Stream Operations:
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David");

// Filtering and mapping
List<String> filteredNames = names.stream()
    .filter(name -> name.length() > 3)
    .map(String::toUpperCase)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Finding elements
Optional<String> firstLongName = names.stream()
    .filter(name -> name.length() > 5)
    .findFirst();

// Reduction operations
int totalLength = names.stream()
    .mapToInt(String::length)
    .sum();

// Parallel processing
boolean anyMatch = names.parallelStream()
    .anyMatch(name -> name.startsWith("A"));
```

## 9. What are intermediate operations in Java Stream API? 🔄

> **Why this is asked**: This drills deeper into Stream API knowledge to check your understanding of lazy evaluation.

Intermediate operations in Java Stream API are operations that transform a stream into another stream. They are lazy, meaning they don't process the elements until a terminal operation is invoked.

### Common Intermediate Operations:

| Operation | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| filter() | Filters elements based on a predicate | `stream.filter(n -> n > 10)` |
| map() | Transforms each element using a function | `stream.map(String::toUpperCase)` |
| flatMap() | Maps each element to a stream and flattens | `stream.flatMap(Collection::stream)` |
| distinct() | Returns a stream with unique elements | `stream.distinct()` |
| sorted() | Returns a sorted stream | `stream.sorted()` or `stream.sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder())` |
| peek() | Performs an action on each element without modifying | `stream.peek(System.out::println)` |
| limit() | Limits the size of the stream | `stream.limit(5)` |
| skip() | Skips the first n elements | `stream.skip(3)` |

### Contrast with Terminal Operations:
Terminal operations (like collect(), forEach(), reduce()) produce a result or a side-effect and end the stream pipeline processing.

## 10. If you get an error saying 'ApplicationContext is not loading', what could be the reason? 🔍

> **Why this is asked**: This tests your troubleshooting skills and ability to resolve common Spring issues.

When Spring's ApplicationContext fails to load, several issues could be causing the problem:

### Common Causes:
1. **Missing or incorrect configuration**:
   - Spring configuration files not found

- Check for circular dependencies
- Ensure all required dependencies are on the classpath
- Verify property configurations and profiles

## 11. How do you maintain security in a Java-based web project? 🔒

> **Why this is asked**: Security is critical in enterprise applications; this evaluates your security awareness.

### Authentication & Authorization:
- Implement secure authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
- Use Spring Security for comprehensive security
- Apply proper role-based access control
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

### Input Validation:
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides

public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/login")
                .permitAll()
            .and()
            .logout()
                .permitAll()
            .and()
            .csrf().csrfTokenRepository(CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse());
    }
    
    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```

## 12. How do you use profiles in Spring Boot? 🔀

> **Why this is asked**: This tests your ability to manage different deployment environments with Spring Boot.

Profiles in Spring Boot allow you to configure different beans and properties for different environments (development, testing, production).

### Setting Up Profiles:

1. **Creating profile-specific properties files**:
   - `application-dev.properties`
   - `application-test.properties`
   - `application-prod.properties`

2. **Using YAML with profiles**:
```yaml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: dev
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: dev
server:
  port: 8080
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: prod
server:
  port: 5000
```

3. **Setting active profile**:
   - In `application.properties`: `spring.profiles.active=dev`
   - Command line: `--spring.profiles.active=dev`
   - Environment variable: `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev`
   - Programmatically: `SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles("dev")`

4. **Profile-specific beans**:
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    
    @Bean
    @Profile("dev")
    public DataSource devDataSource() {
        // Return in-memory database
    }
    
    @Bean
    @Profile("prod")
    public DataSource prodDataSource() {
        // Return production database
    }
}
```

5. **Component-level profiles**:
```java
@Service
@Profile("dev")
public class DevService implements MyService {
    // Development implementation
}

@Service
@Profile("prod")
public class ProdService implements MyService {
    // Production implementation
}
```

## 13. If you have a web application, how can you improve its performance? ⚡

> **Why this is asked**: Performance optimization is a key skill; this checks if you can identify bottlenecks and solutions.

### Server-Side Optimizations:
- **Caching**:
  - Implement caching layers (Redis, Memcached)
  - Use Spring's caching abstraction
  - Apply HTTP caching headers

- **Database Optimization**:
  - Optimize queries and indexes
  - Use connection pooling
  - Implement database sharding for large datasets
  - Consider NoSQL solutions for specific use cases

- **Application Level**:
  - Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
  - Implement pagination for large data sets
  - Optimize session management
  - Use lazy loading where appropriate

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Scale horizontally with load balancing
  - Utilize CDN for static content
  - Implement proper logging levels
  - Use proper JVM tuning

### Client-Side Optimizations:
- Minify and bundle JavaScript and CSS
- Optimize and compress images
- Implement lazy loading for images and components
- Use browser caching effectively

### Code Example (Spring Caching):
```java
@Configuration
@EnableCaching
public class CachingConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public CacheManager cacheManager() {
        SimpleCacheManager cacheManager = new SimpleCacheManager();
        cacheManager.setCaches(Arrays.asList(
            new ConcurrentMapCache("users"),
            new ConcurrentMapCache("products")
        ));
        return cacheManager;
    }
}

@Service
public class ProductService {
    
    @Cacheable("products")
    public Product getProductById(Long id) {
        // This result will be cached
        return productRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
    }
    
    @CacheEvict("products")
    public void updateProduct(Product product) {
        // This will clear the cache after update
        productRepository.save(product);
    }
}
```

## 14. What is an abstract class in Java, and how is it used? 🧩

> **Why this is asked**: This fundamental OOP concept tests your understanding of class hierarchies and code reuse.

An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be subclassed. It can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).

### Key Characteristics:
- Cannot be instantiated directly
- May contain abstract methods and concrete methods
- Can have constructors, static methods, and final methods
- Can have instance variables and constants
- A class that extends an abstract class must implement all its abstract methods

### Example:
```java
public abstract class Shape {
    // Instance variable
    protected String color;
    
    // Constructor
    public Shape(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }
    
    // Concrete method
    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }
    
    // Abstract method
    public abstract double calculateArea();
    
    // Abstract method
    public abstract double calculatePerimeter();
}

// Concrete subclass
public class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;
    
    public Circle(String color, double radius) {
        super(color);
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    
    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
    
    @Override
    public double calculatePerimeter() {
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
    }
}
```

### When to Use Abstract Classes:
- When you want to share code among closely related classes
- When the subclasses would share common methods or fields
- When you need to provide a template for subclasses to follow
- When you want to declare non-static or non-final fields

## 15. What is the difference between a process and a thread in Java? ⚙️

> **Why this is asked**: This checks your understanding of Java's concurrency model and system resources.

| Feature | Process | Thread |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Definition | Independent program in execution | Lightweight sub-process, smallest unit of processing |
| Memory | Has its own memory space | Shares memory space with other threads in same process |
| Communication | Inter-process communication is complex and resource-intensive | Direct communication through shared memory |
| Creation | Resource-intensive and slower to create | Lightweight and faster to create |
| Context Switching | Expensive | Less expensive |
| Failure Impact | Failure of one process doesn't affect others | Failure of one thread can affect other threads in the same process |
| Synchronization | Not needed between processes | Required for thread safety |

### Java Thread Management:
```java
// Creating a thread
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    // Thread's task
    System.out.println("Thread is running");
});

// Starting the thread
thread.start();

// Joining a thread (waiting for it to complete)
try {
    thread.join();
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
}

// Checking thread state
Thread.State state = thread.getState();
```

### Process vs Thread Visualization:
```
Process:
[Process A] [Process B] [Process C]
  (Memory)    (Memory)    (Memory)
  
Thread:
[Process]
  |
  |-- [Thread 1]
  |-- [Thread 2]
  |-- [Thread 3]
  (Shared Memory)
```
